## Question 01 (True/False)

Like a matrix, a data frame requires all of its columns to have a same mode/type.


## Question 02 (Multiple-Choice)

A data frame d contains two variables, age and sex. Which one of the following command will NOT work for accessing values of age?

< d
  age    sex
1  24 female  
2  21 female
3  30   male

A. d$age
B. d[[1]]
C. d[1, ]
D. d[, 1]


## Question 03 (Short Answer)

The following data frame (exp) contains five variables measured/assigned in an experiment: participant id, age, sex, assigned condition, and treatment effect.


> exp
  id age    sex condition effect
1  1  18   male treatment    3.5
2  2  18 female   control    3.7
3  3  23 female treatment    4.4
4  4  22   male   control    6.3
5  5  24   male treatment    5.4
6  6  19 female treatment    3.5


Q03.a: Provide R code for extracting a subdata frame which only contains the effect variable (hint: the returned object should be a new data frame, not a vector). 

Q03.b: Provide R code for extracting a subdata frame which contains the five variables ONLY for the female participants (hint: "female" should be used in the code, instead of female without quotation marks).

Q03.c: Provide R code for extracting a subdata frame which contains the five variables ONLY for participants over age 21.


## Question 04 (True/False)

When we use the subset() function to extract subdata frames from a data frame containing missing data, we need to include na.rm = TRUE if we want R to ignor the missing values (NA).


## Question 05 (Short Answer)

The following data frame contains five variables (with missing responses) from a survey study: participant id, age, sex, education level, and monthly income. 

> survey
  id age    sex       education month.income
1  1  28   male         college         4500
2  2  NA female     high school         4000
3  3  31   <NA>         college           NA
4  4  NA   male            <NA>         4800
5  5  36   male graduate school           NA
6  6  26 female            <NA>         3000

Q05.a: Can we use the following code to caculate the average monthly income of these six participants? Why?
                                                                                                           > mean(month.income)

Q05.b: Provide the code, use the subset() function in R, for extracting a subdata frame ONLY contains participants whose monthly income equals to or above 4000.

Q05.c: What is the result of the following code?

> rbind(survey, list(7, 40, "male", "high school", 2500))


## Question 06 (True/False)

We can use apply() on data frames, if the columns are all the same type.


## Question 07 (R exercise; pp. 109-111)

Step 1: Reproduce the following three dataframes (d1, d2, and d3).

> d1
  student exam.1
1    Jack     85
2    Jill     88
3 Jillian     75
4    John     82

> d2
  student exam.2
1    Jack     88
2    Jill     73
3 Lillian     80
4    John     74

> d3
     name exam.3
1    Jack     90
2    Jill     83
3 Lillian     76
4    John     80


Step 2: Use the merge() function to merge d1 and d2 (name the merged data frame as d).

Step 3: Use the merge() function to merge d and d3 (assuming d$student and d3$name have similar information but different names). 


## Question 08 (R Exercise; pp. 113-114)

Step 1: Use the following code to obtain the information about a dataset (swiss) in R.

> ?swiss
> head(swiss)

Step 2: Review the 5.4.2 Extended Example: Applying Logistic Regression Models (pp. 113-114)

Step 3: Try to adapt the R code for running logistic regressions on a dataframe (p. 114), so we can predict Fertility (the first variable in the swiss data) by the other five variables using the lm() function.
