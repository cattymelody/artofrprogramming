1. How many data types may be stored in a vector?

2. What does R do when applying an operation to two vectors.
In math class, they said it is only allowed to add vectors of the
same length.  Explain the following.

A. Compare

c(1, 2, 3) + c(10, 9, 8) 

B. c(1, 2, 3) + 1

C. c(1, 2, 3) + c(10, 5)

D. c(1, 2, 3) + c(10, 5, -10, 30)


3. How would you extract vale 3, 4, and 7 from vector x <- rnorm(10)?

4. How would you write the equivalent of for(i in 1:length(x)) using
seq() (or seq_along)?

5. What does it mean for a function to be vectorized?
