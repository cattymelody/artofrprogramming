## Question 01 (Multiple-Choice)

A pdf file (a histogram of 100 values) was created using the following R script. Which line of the script causes the file to be writen to the disk?

A. > pdf("filename.pdf")
B. > hist(rnorm(100))
C. > dev.off()
D. all of the above


## Question 02 (Multiple-Choice)

We created a vector q by using the following R code. What is the total number of elements in q?

> x <- c(1, 4, 8)
> q <- c(x, 5)

A. 3
B. 4
C. 5
D. 6

## Question 03 (True/False)

The elements of a vector must all have the same mode, or data type.


## Question 04 (True/False)

We can create a three-element vector in R that has one integer element and two character string elements.


## Question 05 (True/False)

An R list can contain items of different data types.


## Question 06 (True/False)

Subscripts for indexing matrices in R start at 0.


## Question 07 (True/False)

A data frame in R is a list.


## Question 08 (R Exercise)

A function, evencount(), was created using the following code. It counts the number of even integers in x.

evencount <- function(x) {
    k <- 0
    for (n in x) {
        if (n %% 2 == 0) k <- k + 1
    }
    return(k)
}

Step 1: Run the above code in R to create the function.

Step 2: Use c() to create a vector j with some integers.

Step 3: Apply the evencount() function to j. Did it work?
